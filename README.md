# Phace-Multiplayer-Bullet-Hell
## Overview
Phace is a Top-Down Bullet-Hell with Multiplayer feature. 
It is constructed as a school project and is still subject to change. The idea is a fast paced **arcade bullet hell** in top-down perspective in which players may or may not _cooperate_ to beat wave after wave of enemies, beat bosses and reach highscores.
Phace takes place in unfathomable space, each player controlling their own spacecraft that we intend to make customizable and adjust gameplay accordingly.
