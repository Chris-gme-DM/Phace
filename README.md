# Phace-Multiplayer-Bullet-Hell
## Overview
Phace is a Top-Down Bullet-Hell with Multiplayer feature. 
It is constructed as a school project and is still subject to change. The idea is a fast paced **arcade bullet hell** in top-down perspective in which players may or may not _cooperate_ to beat wave after wave of enemies, beat bosses and reach highscores.
Phace takes place in unfathomable space, each player controlling their own spacecraft that I intend to make customizable and adjust gameplay acocordingly.
