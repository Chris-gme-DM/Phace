# Phace-Multiplayer-Bullet-Hell
## Overview
Phace is a Top-Down Bullet-Hell with Multiplayer feature. 
It is constructed as a school project and is still subject to change. The idea is a fast paced **arcade bullet hell** in top-down perspective in which players may or may not _cooperate_ to beat wave after wave of enemies, beat bosses and reach highscores.
Phace takes place in unfathomable space, each player controlling their own spacecraft that we intend to make customizable and adjust gameplay accordingly.

## Work Rules
These rules are for all contributors to follow and establish a healthy work environment. Tools we use for organization:
+ Discord
+ Miro
### Interpersonal Rules
+ Respect each other
+ Listen to each other
+ Open communication
+ We agree to not talk about the project between 0am - 8am
+ Coffee and cigarettes are each contributors own responsibility, sharing of tobacco is welcome
### Workflow rules
+ Each contributor works in their own Workspace branch
+ Overarching Issues are discussed and opened, assignment to an issue follows work capacity
+ Sub issues can be opened by the assigned contributor on their own without further discussion
+ We established a folder structure in unity to not disrupt each others workspace.
+ Scenes are established or copied to work on issues
+ Chris is authorative to version control, contributors commit to their workbranches after an issue is closed, merged project files are shared via the dev branch, contributors open their workbranch from that point on
### Naming conventions and commentary
+ Follow standard C# conventions
+ Summaries should describe the functionality and have a comment by the last editor of the codeblock, if the script is edited across the team
+ Comments written above a line are either to point out relevance in the flow or help keeping track for the editor
+ Comments written right of the lineshould point out issues, queries, bugs and other special cases
